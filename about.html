            <p> Hello! My name is Christian Collins and I am from Braintree, Massachusetts. I am currently a freshman</br>
                at the University of Rhode Island. In my free time I mostly enjoy playing games, listening to music, </br>
                hanging out with friends, and more recently learning guitar. In high school, I participated in crew  </br>
                all four years.
