        <h1> Welcome to Christian Collins' Programming Portfolio!</h1>
        <p> Thank you for coming to my website. I created this site for the CSC 106 class at the University of Rhode Island.<br>
            The site is mostly empty at the moment, but will later contain some of my javascripts and apps. You can click <br>
            around at the top to access the different parts of the website such as the "about me" page. Javascripts and apps<br>
            are empty like I said. This website was created using HTML.</p>
